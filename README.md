# Evolutionary Multi-Objective Optimization of Cell Models
Repository for the code used to run the experiments in the paper LEQUERTIER A., LIEBERMEISTER W., TONDA A. 2025. Inferring Reaction Elasticities in Cells from Metabolic State Correlations through Multi-objective Evolutionary Optimization, In: Proceedings of the 28th International Conference on the Applications of Evolutionary Computation (EvoAPPS/EvoSTAR), DOI: TBA

## Reproduce the experiment on the 4-reaction pathway 
Once all packages are installed, change directory to `src/` and run `python3 pymoo_optimization.py`. The experiments on the full-scale metabolic model of E.coli might take hours of computational time.
